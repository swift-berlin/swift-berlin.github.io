    title: How moving to manual dependency management saved us app startup and build time.
    abstract: Cocoapods is a de-facto standard in iOS dependency management. Nevertheless, with complex project structure it becomes hard to maintain. I'll tell you a story of transitioning our project from Cocoapods to manual dependency management, which improved our project structure, build time and app startup time.

    title: "How I came with peace with Core Data."
    abstract: Mobile applications tend to need more local data storage nowadays. CoreData is a powerful tool for storing and querying locally stored information. In the first glance it may appears a little complicated to setup and use its power, at least this was the case to me. This talk aims to present a quick and easy way to setup Core Data. If you are interested to take a look before the meet-up, checkout the github link below.

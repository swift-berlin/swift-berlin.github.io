    title: "How I came with peace with Core Data."
    abstract: Mobile applications tend to need more local data storage nowadays. CoreData is a powerful tool for storing and querying locally stored information. In the first glance it may appears a little complicated to setup and use its power, at least this was the case to me. This talk aims to present a quick and easy way to setup Core Data. If you are interested to take a look before the meet-up, checkout the github link below.

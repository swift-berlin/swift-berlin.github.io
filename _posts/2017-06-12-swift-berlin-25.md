    title: When Apple meets AR
    abstract: "It's time for AR! The last WWDC was full of announcements: one of them concerns Augmented Reality features now offered through iOS 11. Rather than a technical deep dive into the possibilities now offered by iOS 11, this talk aims to raise interest within Berlin swift developers community about the new functionalities that can be included within apps and for those interested participate to a future Meetup with AR Berlin Meetup community around this topic."
